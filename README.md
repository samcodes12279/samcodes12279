# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hey, my name is Sam! I am a Community Moderator with Netlify. I am deeply passionate about education, and technology and learning how to combine the intersection between the two. I am currently a PhD student at Newcastle and I love teaching undergraduates in my spare time.

I am super introverted but can be extroverted when I feel comfortable (I am an INFJ). I am a first generation Nigerian American immigrant based out in Texas. I love travelling and have been to over 9 countries (really trying to hit that 30 countries by 30 goal).

## What are your primary goals as a human being?
* I want to be an encylopedia for all knowledge that is pertinent
* I want to be a lifelong learner. I believe access to education is the key to success and really working on a growth mindset will get you there.

## What do you want us to know about your communication style?
* I am very shy and often struggle reading social interactions. I try hard to come out of my shell because once I do I am very extroverted and can likely talk your ear off.
* I love 'disclosure reciprocity' so often times I will use that to build rapport with people especially when we first meet just to even the playing ground and make us all feel comfortable.
* Written communication has my heart. There is no tone in an slack message (most of the time) or emails. I know exactly what needs to be done when information is relayed to me written. If there is still a misunderstanding I then pivot towards oral communication. In the interest of time and saving everyones from hopping on a zoom, shoot me a message first!

## What are some useful things to know in advance about your style?
* I am autistic, so sometimes I can come off blunt or rude when I communicate. That is NEVER my intention I am still learning what is socially appropriate and how the average neurotypical individual behaves.
* I prefer direct communication. I am very neurotic and can often times dive way deeper than I should into something and it will be easier for everyone if you are straight to the point with your ask.

## How can you best work with me?
*  Please show me how you do something, record it, and write it down in detail. I love the opportunity to cross reference something that was written in the past as it allows me to easily remember.

## What are your pet peeves?
* Cats. They are extremely gross and super scary.
* Inconsistency. I work hard to be a reliable person and I am very type A. It's really frustrating when I am dependenable and others are not. 
* Toxic Positivity. What is it? The excessive and ineffective overgeneralization of a happy optimisitc state across all situations. This is a pet peeve of mine because it creates a false sense of self that can be isolating and even gaslighting in some cases.

## What are your self-percieved biggest shortcomings?
* I am unbelievably hard on myself after setting wildly unrealistic expectations.
* Self- doubt. I have a hard time believing I am capable of literally anything.
